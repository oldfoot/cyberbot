CYBERBOT

This was a simple project I created back in about 2005. It's a simple articificial intelligence modelling language app
that allows you to ahve a basic conversation with a computer program.

You need:
PHP
mySQL
a web browser
a web server

I recomment downloading XAMPP from Apache Friends (Google it)

Install the database from db/, copy the files to your home directory (e.g. c:/xampp/htdocs/cyberbot or /var/www/html) and then open your browser
and it should all work. You might need to look at the config.php file and make changes.
